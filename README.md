# Linear System Identification & Regression Simulator

Interactive simulator for data-driven modeling using linear regression.

This project implements a complete least-squares regression model to estimate  
**y = a + b·x** from experimental data and visualize:
- Fitted regression line  
- Residuals (errors)  
- Coefficient of determination (R²)

The tool is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Chart.js for interactive graphics, and validated with Python and NumPy for numerical accuracy.

It can be used to model and analyze:
- Distance vs time  
- Torque vs speed  
- Cost vs production  
- Sensor calibration  
- Demand vs consumption  

This project follows the principles of **System Identification and Empirical Modeling**, where mathematical models are derived directly from data rather than theoretical equations.
