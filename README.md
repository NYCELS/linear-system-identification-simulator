# Linear System Identification & Regression Simulator

This project implements a complete linear regression model from scratch
(using the least-squares method), allowing users to input experimental X and Y data,
estimate the model:

y = a + b·x

and visualize:
- the fitted regression line  
- residuals (errors)  
- coefficient of determination (R²)

The simulator is built with **HTML, JavaScript and Chart.js** for the interactive
graphical interface, and **Python with NumPy** was used to validate the mathematical
model, test datasets and verify the regression and error calculations.

The system can be used to model physical, financial and engineering processes such as:
- distance vs time  
- torque vs speed  
- cost vs production  
- sensor calibration  
- demand vs consumption  

This project follows the principles of **System Identification and Empirical Modeling**,
where a mathematical model is obtained directly from experimental data instead of
purely theoretical equations. The regression parameters (a and b) are computed using
the closed-form least-squares equations, ensuring full transparency and numerical
reliability.
